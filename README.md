## Interface Walkthrough

Sigil's frontend is designed for clarity, responsiveness, and developer-first workflows. Once the application is running, here's what the interface provides:

### Model Loading

After startup, the frontend will prompt you to select a model. Options may include loading from a local path or choosing a pre-defined model name discovered by the backend. Upon submission:

- The backend loads the model via the `/api/v1/model/load` or `/api/v1/model/load/{model_name}` endpoint.
- Real-time status updates appear in `backend/backend_api.log`
- On success, the chat interface becomes available

### Chat Interface

After loading a model, the frontend presents a clean interface to interact with it:

- Type prompts and receive model responses
- Backend routes input through either instruction or chat prompt templates
- Frontend displays complete output once inference is completed
- **Chats are Saved:** Your conversations are automatically saved locally, so you can close the application and resume your chat later.
- **Settings Persist:** Sampling parameters (like temperature, top_p, etc.) are saved with each chat and will be restored when you reopen it.
- **Multiple Chats:** Sigil supports multiple chat instances, allowing you to work with different models or conversations simultaneously.

### Themes

Sigil supports both light and dark variants of each theme. The theme system is designed to be easily extensible:

- Each theme consists of CSS variables defining colors and UI properties
- Themes automatically support both light and dark modes
- Custom themes can be added by creating new CSS files in the `frontend/public/themes` directory
- **Update:** An AI Assistant plugin for automated theme creation is currently in development.

### Examples of a few themes

### Developer Tools and Feedback

- All requests are routed through the FastAPI backend
- Adjust generation settings (e.g. `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_new_tokens`) via the `/api/v1/settings/update` endpoint
- VRAM status can be accessed via the `/api/v1/vram` endpoint if GPU is enabled
- Available models can be listed via `/models` endpoint.
- Available themes can be listed via `/themes` endpoint.
- Logs provide visibility into model status and runtime behavior

This interface is ideal for local experimentation, debugging, and integrating lightweight LLMs into your workflow without external dependencies.

## Prerequisites

*   Python 3.8+ (tested with 3.9)
*   `pip` (Python package installer)
*   Node.js and `npm` (for the frontend development server and building)
*   A compatible Hugging Face transformer model downloaded locally (e.g., TinyLlama). The model directory should contain files like `*.safetensors` or `pytorch_model.bin`, `config.json`, `tokenizer.json`, etc.

[Back to Top](#top)

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Thrasher-Intelligence/sigil
    cd https://github.com/Thrasher-Intelligence/sigil
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: Installing `torch` can sometimes be complex. If you need a specific version (e.g., for CUDA), refer to the official PyTorch installation guide: <https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/>*

4.  **Install Frontend dependencies:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    npm install
    cd ..
    ```
    *(Note: Frontend dependencies are managed by `package.json` in the root directory).*

5.  **(Optional but Recommended) Download or Place Models:**
    *   Download models (like TinyLlama) as described before.
    *   Place the downloaded model directories inside the `backend/models/` directory. This allows loading them by name (e.g., `TinyLlama-1.1B-Chat-v1.0`).
    *   Alternatively, you can still load models from any local path using the UI.

## Running the Development Environment

1.  **Ensure your Python virtual environment is activated.**

2.  **Run the appropriate development startup script for your platform:**
    
    **For macOS/Linux:**
    ```bash
    ./scripts/start_dev.sh
    ```
    
    **For Windows (PowerShell):**
    ```powershell
    .\scripts\start_dev.ps1
    ```
    
    **For Windows (Command Prompt):**
    ```
    scripts\start_dev.bat
    ```

3.  **Wait for Startup:**
    *   The script first starts the backend API server (Uvicorn). You'll see logs in `backend_api.log`. It will indicate if CUDA is detected.
    *   Then, it starts the frontend Vite development server (usually accessible at `http://localhost:5173`).

4.  **Load Model & Chat:**
    *   Open your web browser to the frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:5173`).
    *   The web UI should provide an interface to specify the path to your model directory *or* select a model name listed from `backend/models/`.
    *   Once the model path/name is submitted, the frontend will call the appropriate backend API endpoint (`/api/v1/model/load` or `/api/v1/model/load/{model_name}`) to load the model. Watch the backend logs (`backend/backend_api.log`) for progress.
    *   After the model is loaded successfully, you can use the chat interface.

5.  **Stopping:**
    *   Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where `start_dev.sh` is running. The script will handle shutting down both the backend and frontend processes.

## Customization

*   **Generation Parameters:**
    *   Defaults are set in `backend/api/main.py` (e.g., `app.state.temperature`).
    *   The `/api/v1/settings/update` endpoint allows changing parameters like `temperature`, `top_p`, `max_new_tokens`, and `system_prompt` at runtime. The frontend in `frontend/src/` needs to be adjusted to expose UI controls for this.
*   **Backend API:** Add or modify endpoints in `backend/api/routes/` and register routers in `backend/api/main.py`. Update core logic in `backend/core/`.
*   **Frontend UI:** Modify the React components and logic in `frontend/src/`.
*   **Model Loading Logic:** Found within the `load_model_internal` and `load_model_by_name` functions in `backend/core/model_loader.py` and the corresponding API endpoints in `backend/api/routes/models.py` (implied location).
*   **Themes:** Add new `.css` files to `frontend/public/themes/`. They will be automatically available via the `/themes` endpoint.
